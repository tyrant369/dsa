1. why we use n - 1 interartions?

ans:-
           Since in a graph of N nodes, in worst case, you will
           take N-1 edges to reach from the first to the last,
           thereby we iterate for N-1 iterations.
           Try drawing a graph which takes more than N-1 edges
           for any path, it is not possible.

2. How to detect a negative cycle in the graph?

ans:-
            We know if we keep on rotating inside a negative cycle,
            the path weight will be decreased in every iteration. But
            according to our intuition, we should have minimized all
            distances within N-1 iterations(that means, after N-1
            iterations no relaxation of edges is possible).
            In order to check the existence of a negative cycle,
            we will relax the edges one more time after the completion of
            N-1 iterations. And if in that Nth iteration, it is found that
            further relaxation of any edge is possible, we can conclude that the
            graph has a negative cycle. Thus, the Bellman-Ford algorithm detects
            negative cycles.
